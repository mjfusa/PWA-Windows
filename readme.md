# My PWA+Windows

This tutorial will walk you through adding the necessary code to convert an Angular app to a Progressive Web App that supports native Windows 10 features (Toast, Tiles, and Background Tasks).

We'll take a step by step approach, creating the web app, using tools to check its' compliance with PWA standards, and then add the neccesary code to close those gaps. Finally we'll add support for a few Windows 10 features - adding value to the app when it runs on Windows 10.

Here are the modules covered. Each module is in it's own git branch. Change branches to navigate between the modules.
